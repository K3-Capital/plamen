Codex Adapter Generator

Reads Plamen's Claude-side manifests and generates Codex-compatible config files.
This prevents drift -- when Claude-side files change, re-running this script
updates the Codex files automatically.

Usage:
    python scripts/codex_adapter.py [--output-dir codex/]

Sources:
    - hooks/phase_manifest.json    (phase/artifact specs)
    - settings.json.example        (MCP server configs, permissions)
    - mcp.json.example             (MCP server definitions)
    - CLAUDE.md                    (orchestrator rules)
    - agents/depth-*.md            (agent role definitions)

NOTE: Phase 1 generator. Most output content is templated, not fully derived
from Claude-side manifests. The following IS manifest-driven:
  - config.toml MCP servers (from mcp.json.example)
  - hooks.json (from phase_manifest.json)
  - Agent role file list (from agents/depth-*.md listing)
The following is TEMPLATED and must be updated manually if Claude-side changes:
  - AGENTS.md orchestrator rules
  - SKILL.md phase sequence
  - Agent role developer_instructions

Phase 2 goal: derive more content from CLAUDE.md and commands/plamen.md parsing.

    # Plamen -- Web3 Security Auditing Agent

    You are **Plamen**, an autonomous Web3 security auditing agent running inside Codex.
    Your methodology, prompts, and skill files live in `~/.codex/plamen/`.

    ## Audit Modes

    | Dimension | Light | Core | Thorough |
    |-----------|-------|------|----------|
    | Orchestrator model | Sonnet-class | Opus-class | Opus-class |
    | Agent models | All Sonnet/Haiku | Opus + Sonnet | Opus + Sonnet |
    | Recon agents | 2 | 4 | 4 (full RAG) |
    | Breadth agents | 3-4 | 5-9 | 5-9 + re-scan |
    | Depth loop | 4 agents, 1 iter | 8+ agents, 1 iter | Iter 1-3 (DA role) |
    | Niche agents | Skip | Flag-triggered | Flag-triggered |
    | Verification | Chains + Medium+ | Chains + Medium+ | ALL severities |
    | Report agents | 2 | 5 | 5 |
    | Approx agent count | ~18-22 | ~30-50 | ~40-100 |

    ## Critical Rules

    1. **YOU ARE THE ORCHESTRATOR** -- Spawn agents directly, never delegate orchestration.
    2. **MCP TOOLS VIA AGENTS** -- Recon agent calls MCP tools, not you directly.
    3. **INSTANTIATE, DON'T INJECT** -- Templates have `{PLACEHOLDERS}` that you replace.
       For phase templates with embedded agent prompts (invariant-fuzz, Medusa), pass the
       template file path TO THE AGENT -- the agent reads and follows the full methodology.
    4. **DYNAMIC AGENT COUNT** -- Scale based on protocol complexity.
    5. **PARALLEL ANALYSIS** -- All analysis agents for a phase spawn in ONE message.
       Every agent prompt for phases 3/4b MUST end with:
       `"SCOPE: Write ONLY to your assigned output file. Do NOT read or write other agents'
       output files. Do NOT proceed to subsequent pipeline phases. Return your findings and stop."`
    6. **CONTEXT PROTECTION** -- Don't read large files; agents read them.
    7. **METHODOLOGY NOT ANSWERS** -- Tell agents WHAT to analyze, not WHAT to find.
    8. **NO REPORT BEFORE VERIFICATION** -- Verify before reporting.
    9. **SEVERITY MATRIX** -- Use Impact x Likelihood.
    10. **MCP TIMEOUT POLICY** -- Agents that call MCP tools must NOT retry on timeout.
        Record `[MCP: TIMEOUT]` and switch to fallback.

    ## Phase Sequence

    Follow the phase graph in `~/.codex/plamen/hooks/phase_manifest.json`:

    ```
    Recon (1) -> Breadth (2) -> Inventory (3) -> [Re-scan (4)] -> [Per-contract (5)]
    -> [Semantic Invariants (6)] -> Depth Loop (7) -> Chain Analysis (8)
    -> Verification (9) -> Report (10)
    ```

    Phases in brackets are mode-dependent. Each phase has required artifacts that
    MUST exist before proceeding to the next phase (enforced by phase_gate.py).

    ## File References

    | Purpose | Location |
    |---------|----------|
    | Finding format | `~/.codex/plamen/rules/finding-output-format.md` |
    | Confidence scoring | `~/.codex/plamen/rules/phase4-confidence-scoring.md` |
    | Chain prompt | `~/.codex/plamen/rules/phase4c-chain-prompt.md` |
    | PoC execution | `~/.codex/plamen/rules/phase5-poc-execution.md` |
    | Report prompts | `~/.codex/plamen/rules/phase6-report-prompts.md` |
    | Report template | `~/.codex/plamen/rules/report-template.md` |
    | Skill index | `~/.codex/plamen/rules/skill-index.md` |
    | Depth agents | `~/.codex/plamen/agents/depth-*.md` |
    | Language prompts | `~/.codex/plamen/prompts/{LANGUAGE}/` |
    | Skills | `~/.codex/plamen/agents/skills/{LANGUAGE}/` |

    Resolve `{LANGUAGE}` to `evm`, `solana`, `aptos`, `sui`, or `soroban`
    based on Step 1 language detection.

    ## Agent Roles

    Use the TOML role definitions in `~/.codex/agents/` to spawn sub-agents.
    Each role specifies model, tools, and developer instructions pointing to
    the full methodology files in `~/.codex/plamen/`.

    ## Artifact Discipline

    - Write ONLY to your assigned output file in the scratchpad directory.
    - The scratchpad is created at `{PROJECT_ROOT}/.scratchpad/` on audit start.
    - Each agent writes to exactly one file (e.g., `depth_token_flow_findings.md`).
    - Phase gates check artifact existence before allowing phase transitions.

    # Plamen Security Audit Pipeline (Codex Orchestrator)

    ## Usage

    ```
    /plamen [light|core|thorough] [path/to/project]
    ```

    When invoked, follow this orchestration sequence.

    ## Step 0: Parse Arguments

    Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:
    - If it contains "light", "core", or "thorough", set `MODE` accordingly (default: core).
    - If it contains a path, set `PROJECT_ROOT` to that path. Otherwise use cwd.
    - If it contains `docs:` followed by a path, set `DOCS_PATH`.
    - If it contains `scope:` followed by a path, set `SCOPE_FILE`.
    - If it contains `notes:` followed by text, set `SCOPE_NOTES`.

    ## Step 1: Language Detection

    Detect the project's smart contract language by scanning `PROJECT_ROOT`:

    | Detection | Language |
    |-----------|----------|
    | `foundry.toml` or `.sol` files | `evm` |
    | `Anchor.toml` or `programs/` with `.rs` | `solana` |
    | `Move.toml` with `[addresses]` + `aptos` deps | `aptos` |
    | `Move.toml` with `sui` deps | `sui` |
    | `Cargo.toml` with `soroban-sdk` | `soroban` |

    Set `LANGUAGE` to the detected value. This resolves all `{LANGUAGE}` placeholders
    in file paths throughout the pipeline.

    ## Step 2: Create Scratchpad

    ```bash
    mkdir -p {PROJECT_ROOT}/.scratchpad
    ```

    Set `SCRATCHPAD = {PROJECT_ROOT}/.scratchpad`.

    ## Step 3: Initialize Watchdog

    ```bash
    python3 ~/.codex/plamen/hooks/phase_gate.py --init {SCRATCHPAD} {MODE} {PROJECT_ROOT}
    ```

    ## Step 4: Execute Phase Sequence

    Read `~/.codex/plamen/hooks/phase_manifest.json` for the phase ordering and
    artifact requirements. Execute phases in order, checking gates between phases.

    ### Phase 1: Reconnaissance (4-Agent Split)

    Do NOT spawn a single monolithic recon agent. Split into 4 parallel agents
    for timeout isolation (confirmed failure on large projects with single agent).

    Read the full recon prompt structure from:
    `~/.codex/plamen/prompts/{LANGUAGE}/phase1-recon-prompt.md`

    **Agent 1A: RAG Meta-Buffer** (FIRE-AND-FORGET)
    - Tasks: TASK 0 steps 1-5 (vuln-db probe + Solodit queries)
    - Model: o3-mini (mechanical query+format task)
    - Spawn with `spawn_agent` and do NOT wait for completion
    - Writes: `meta_buffer.md`
    - If still running after Agents 1B/2/3 finish, abandon it and write:
      `meta_buffer.md` with `## RAG: UNAVAILABLE - agent timed out`

    **Agent 1B: Docs + External + Fork** (foreground)
    - Tasks: TASK 0 step 6 (fork ancestry), TASK 3 (docs), TASK 11 (external)
    - Model: o3 (web search + design reasoning)
    - Role: `~/.codex/agents/recon.toml` (with task subset)
    - Writes: `design_context.md`, `external_production_behavior.md`

    **Agent 2: Build + Static + Tests** (foreground)
    - Tasks: TASK 1 (build), TASK 2 (static analysis), TASK 8 (tests), TASK 9 (coverage)
    - Model: o3-mini (tool execution + output formatting)
    - Role: `~/.codex/agents/recon.toml` (with task subset)
    - Writes: `build_status.md`, `function_list.md`, `call_graph.md`,
      `state_variables.md`, `modifiers.md`, `event_definitions.md`,
      `external_interfaces.md`, `static_analysis.md`, `test_results.md`

    **Agent 3: Patterns + Surface + Templates** (foreground)
    - Tasks: TASK 4 (patterns), TASK 5 (inventory), TASK 6 (surface), TASK 7 (flags),
      TASK 10 (templates)
    - Model: o3 (attack surface + template selection requires reasoning)
    - Role: `~/.codex/agents/recon.toml` (with task subset)
    - Writes: `contract_inventory.md`, `attack_surface.md`, `detected_patterns.md`,
      `setter_list.md`, `emit_list.md`, `constraint_variables.md`,
      `template_recommendations.md`

    Wait for Agents 1B, 2, 3 to complete. Check Agent 1A status:
    - If complete: read its `meta_buffer.md` output
    - If still running: write empty `meta_buffer.md` and proceed
    Then write `recon_summary.md` (orchestrator, not an agent).
    Verify all required artifacts exist per phase_manifest.json.

    ### Phase 3: Breadth Analysis

    Read `{SCRATCHPAD}/template_recommendations.md` for agent count and scope split.
    Spawn 3-9 `breadth` agents in parallel (from `~/.codex/agents/breadth.toml`):
    - Each agent gets a unique `{N}` and scope assignment
    - Wait for all to complete
    - Verify at least 3 `analysis_*.md` files exist

    ### Phase 4a: Findings Inventory

    Spawn the `inventory` agent (from `~/.codex/agents/inventory.toml`):
    - Reads all `analysis_*.md` files
    - Produces `findings_inventory.md`

    ### Phase 3b/3c: Re-Scan and Per-Contract (Thorough only)

    If MODE is thorough:
    - Read `~/.codex/plamen/rules/phase3b-rescan-prompt.md` for re-scan methodology
    - Spawn 2-3 `rescan` agents (from `~/.codex/agents/rescan.toml`) with exclusion list
    - Then spawn `per-contract` agents (from `~/.codex/agents/per-contract.toml`),
      one per contract cluster
    - Merge new findings into inventory

    ### Phase 4a.5: Semantic Invariants (Core/Thorough)

    If MODE is core or thorough:
    - Spawn `semantic-invariant` agent (from `~/.codex/agents/semantic-invariant.toml`)
    - Produces `semantic_invariants.md`

    ### Phase 4b: Depth Loop

    Spawn depth agents in parallel from their respective TOML roles:
    - `depth-token-flow.toml`
    - `depth-state-trace.toml`
    - `depth-edge-case.toml`
    - `depth-external.toml`

    Also spawn scanner agents from `scanner.toml`.

    For Core/Thorough: spawn flag-triggered niche agents from `niche-agent.toml`.

    For Thorough mode:
    - Run confidence scoring via `scoring.toml` agent
    - Run iterations 2-3 with DA (Devil's Advocate) role
    - Run RAG sweep via `rag-sweep.toml` agent
    Read `~/.codex/plamen/rules/phase4-confidence-scoring.md` for the full process.

    ### Phase 4c: Chain Analysis

    Spawn `chain-analyzer` agents sequentially:
    1. Agent 1: Enabler enumeration + grouping
    2. Agent 2: Chain matching + composition coverage

    Read `~/.codex/plamen/rules/phase4c-chain-prompt.md` for prompts.

    ### Phase 5: Verification

    Spawn `verifier` agents for each hypothesis batch:
    - Read `~/.codex/plamen/rules/phase5-poc-execution.md` for PoC rules
    - Batch hypotheses by severity (Critical first)
    - Execute PoCs and record verdicts

    ### Phase 6: Report Generation

    Spawn report agents per `~/.codex/plamen/rules/phase6-report-prompts.md`:
    1. `report-index.toml` agent (assigns clean report IDs, tier assignments)
    2. Three parallel `report-tier-writer.toml` agents (Critical+High, Medium, Low+Info)
    3. `report-assembler.toml` agent (combines into AUDIT_REPORT.md)

    ## Artifact Gate Enforcement

    Between each phase, verify required artifacts exist:

    ```bash
    python3 ~/.codex/plamen/hooks/phase_gate.py --stop
    ```

    If artifacts are missing, the gate will block. Complete the current phase
    before proceeding.

    # Plamen Codex Adapter

    This directory contains Codex-compatible configuration files generated from the
    Plamen audit pipeline's Claude-side manifests. These files allow Plamen to run
    inside the [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) in addition to Claude Code.

    ## Installation

    ```bash
    # From the Plamen repo directory:
    plamen install --codex

    # Or manually:
    python scripts/codex_adapter.py
    ```

    The installer:
    1. Generates Codex config files into this `codex/` directory
    2. Creates `~/.codex/` if it does not exist
    3. Symlinks `~/.codex/plamen/` to the Plamen repo (shared methodology files)
    4. Copies Codex-specific files (`config.toml`, agent TOMLs, `AGENTS.md`) into `~/.codex/`

    ## Usage

    After installation, open the Codex CLI and use the Plamen skill:

    ```bash
    codex
    # Then inside Codex:
    /plamen core /path/to/project
    /plamen thorough /path/to/project --docs /path/to/whitepaper.pdf
    ```

    ## Architecture

    ### What is shared (via symlink)

    The Plamen methodology files are shared between Claude Code and Codex via a
    symlink at `~/.codex/plamen/` pointing to the Plamen repo. This includes:

    - `prompts/` -- language-specific phase prompts (recon, inventory, depth, verification)
    - `agents/` -- depth agent definitions and skill files
    - `rules/` -- finding format, confidence scoring, chain analysis, report templates
    - `hooks/` -- phase_gate.py watchdog and phase_manifest.json
    - `custom-mcp/` -- MCP server source code

    ### What is Codex-specific (in this directory)

    - `AGENTS.md` -- Condensed orchestrator rules (under 32KB for Codex context)
    - `config.toml` -- Codex main config with model, MCP server mappings
    - `agents/*.toml` -- Role TOML files for each agent type
    - `skills/plamen/SKILL.md` -- The `/plamen` orchestrator skill for Codex
    - `hooks.json` -- Codex hook format for phase_gate.py

    ### Regenerating

    If you update Claude-side files (CLAUDE.md, phase_manifest.json, mcp.json.example,
    agent definitions), regenerate the Codex files:

    ```bash
    python scripts/codex_adapter.py
    ```

    ## Current Limitations

    - **Phase 1 generator**: Most adapter output content is templated, not fully
      derived from Claude-side manifests. MCP servers (from mcp.json.example),
      hooks (from phase_manifest.json), and agent role file lists (from
      agents/depth-*.md) are manifest-driven. AGENTS.md orchestrator rules,
      SKILL.md phase sequence, and agent developer_instructions are templated
      and must be updated manually when Claude-side files change. Phase 2 goal
      is to derive more content from CLAUDE.md and commands/plamen.md parsing.
    - **Model**: Codex uses `o3` (200K context) vs Claude Code's Opus (1M context).
      Thorough mode may require more careful context management.
    - **Thorough mode parity**: Several Thorough-only features are experimental or
      not yet implemented on Codex. See the Mode Support Status table in
      `skills/plamen/SKILL.md` for details. Skeptic-Judge, invariant fuzz,
      Medusa fuzz, and finding perturbation are not yet available.
    - **MCP servers**: All servers are mapped but may need manual API key configuration
      in `config.toml` (replace `YOUR_*_API_KEY` placeholders).
    - **Hooks**: Codex hook format may differ from Claude Code. The `hooks.json` file
      adapts the phase_gate.py script but event names may need adjustment for your
      Codex version. The `phase_gate.py --track-write` handler supports both
      Claude Code and Codex payload formats.
    - **Platform**: Generated configs assume macOS/Linux (`python3`, forward slashes).
      Windows users should use WSL or adjust paths manually.
