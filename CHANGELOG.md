## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-14

### Initial public release

Plamen is an autonomous Web3 security auditing agent for Claude Code. This is the first open-source release.

### Core Pipeline
- 8-phase audit pipeline: Recon → Instantiation → Breadth Analysis → Re-Scan → Inventory → Depth Loop → Chain Analysis → Verification → Report
- Two audit modes: **Core** (22-40 agents, HIGH/CRIT focus) and **Thorough** (32-90 agents, all severities)
- **Compare** mode for post-audit improvement against ground truth reports
- Adaptive depth loop with 4-axis confidence scoring and Devil's Advocate iteration
- Iterative chain analysis with enabler enumeration and postcondition-precondition matching
- Mandatory PoC execution with fuzz variants for Medium+ findings
- Tiered report generation (Opus for Critical+High, Sonnet for Medium, Sonnet for Low+Info)

### Language Support
- **EVM/Solidity** — 18 skills, Foundry/Hardhat build, Slither integration, fork testing
- **Solana/Anchor** — 19 skills, LiteSVM tests, Trident fuzzing, Helius on-chain data
- **Aptos Move** — 21 skills, Move test framework, resource/capability analysis
- **Sui Move** — 21 skills, test_scenario framework, object ownership analysis

### Skills System
- 79 language-specific skills across 4 trees
- 5 injectable skills (Vault Accounting, Account Abstraction, NFT Protocol, Governance, Outcome Determinism)
- 5 niche agents (Event Completeness, Semantic Gap Investigator, Spec Compliance, Signature Verification, Semantic Consistency)
- Flag-triggered loading to prevent context dilution

### Scanner Templates
- Blind Spot Scanner A: Tokens & Parameters (+ msg.value loops, returnbomb, gas griefing)
- Blind Spot Scanner B: Guards, Visibility & Inheritance + Override Safety
- Blind Spot Scanner C: Role Lifecycle, Capability Exposure & Reachability
- Validation Sweep Agent with write-completeness checks
- Design Stress Testing Agent (Thorough mode, budget redirect)

### Verification Protocol
- Pre-PoC feasibility gates (Reachability + Math Bounds)
- Evidence source tracking with mandatory audit tables
- Mock rejection rule (CONTESTED, not REFUTED, on mock evidence)
- RAG confidence override (historical precedent protection)
- Chain hypothesis protection with full-sequence PoC requirements
- Bidirectional role analysis for semi-trusted actor findings

### MCP Server Integration
- unified-vuln-db: RAG vulnerability database with Solodit API, DeFiHackLabs, Immunefi
- slither-mcp: Slither static analyzer (Trail of Bits)
- farofino-mcp: Solidity analysis fallback
- foundry-suite: Anvil fork testing, Forge scripts, Heimdall bytecode analysis
- evm-chain-data: On-chain contract ABI/state queries
- helius: Solana on-chain data
- tavily-search: Web search for fork ancestry and documentation

### Python Wrapper (plamen.py)
- Terminal UI with Rich + InquirerPy
- Mode selection, target detection, docs/scope/network configuration
- Auto-detection of project type (Foundry, Hardhat, Anchor, Move)
- Dependency checking, Ctrl+C handling, terminal width adaptation
- CLI fast path for scripted usage

### Security Rules
- 16 rules (R1-R16) covering adversarial assumptions, combinatorial impact, bidirectional roles, cached parameters, worst-state severity, unsolicited tokens, exhaustive enablers, anti-normalization, cross-variable invariants, flash loan preconditions, oracle integrity
- Finding output format with step execution tracking and depth evidence tags
- Severity matrix (Impact x Likelihood) with downgrade modifiers
